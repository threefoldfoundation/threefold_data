The new [UI/UX](https://next.dashboard.grid.tf/) of our new dashboard is up for testing. 

<br/>

Great changes around the contracts page, nodes & farmer management pages, and everything you need for deployment is now neatly categorized and [much more](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-new-and-improved-tf-grid-dashboard-ui-ux/4202).

*Thanks to all those involved in this release and bringing it live! We are always open to [feedback](https://github.com/threefoldtech/test_feedback).*
