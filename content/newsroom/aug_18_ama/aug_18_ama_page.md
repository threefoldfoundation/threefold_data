**Please join us for an Ask Me Anything this Wednesday at 17:00 CEST!**

This will be a video AMA. We'll answer questions submitted ahead of time in priority, and if there is time at the end, we will open the floor up for live questions.
<br/>
<br/>
You can submit questions until 12:00 CEST (48 hours) on Wednesday via the link below.

**Additional Context**
<br/>
<br/>
We've heard you loud and clear lately and we‚Äôve decided to do AMAs on a regular basis with our community to answer all your questions in a more efficient way.
<br/>
<br/>
We're unable to follow up on chats, hence the forum thread. This is the only solution we‚Äôve found to 1. answer all your questions and 2. keep the team focused on progress.
