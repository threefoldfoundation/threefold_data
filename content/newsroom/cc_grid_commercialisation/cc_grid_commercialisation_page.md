Following the interest given to [Kristof's message](https://forum.threefold.io/t/grid-commercialisation-brainstorm-call/3808) in the main chat last week, we have scheduled a call to discuss ideas regarding commercial uses of the Grid. It will be held on Tuesday February 28th, at 17:00 CET / 11:00 EST.

<br/>

We encourage you to watch [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryTqvUmM0rQ&t=2501s) of Februaryâ€™s Community Call beforehand, where Kristof gives a preview of existing ideas around the topic at hand.
