FreeFlow Twin (formerly Uhuru) is a digital experience that presents alternatives to centralized social media, messenger, file storage, docs, web browser, and video conferencing.

This is an incredible proof of concept and should be exciting for anybody thatâ€™s involved in this project or seeking a decentralized future!
