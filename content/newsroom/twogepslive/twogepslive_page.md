Calling all farmers! Please head to the ThreeFold Dashboard under the DAO section to vote on the two GEPs which are now live.

<br/>

The first is around changes to the minting code for Farmerbot and the second is related to enhancing the security of nodes. You can find the details of each GEP inside of the links above.

Please note the polls will each close on Wednesday July 6 at approximately 14:30 CEST.
