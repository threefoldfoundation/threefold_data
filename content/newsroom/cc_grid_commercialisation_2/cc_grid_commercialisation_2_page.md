Last week, we had a great brainstorm with the community around ThreeFold DMCC and different possible options for grid commercial offerings. Today we are happy to share the [recording of that call](https://vimeo.com/805551923/69eec7163f) and the [notes/recap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iku8ZyrwagxdcLJvbOmTm4OA_QVwV6BC-gtUiCLh2Cs/edit?usp=sharing).

<br/>

Additionally, we’re announcing the [second brainstorm](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-dmcc-grid-commercialization-brainstorm-round-two/3835), which will take place next Wednesday, March 15th, at 17:00 CET / 11:00 EST.

<br/>

For this week, let’s use the forum post and the notes document to build on or add ideas, and we’ll reconvene next week to push this important effort forward. We’re planning the session for ~two hours. Looking forward to seeing you then!

<br/>

_Note: We had to reschedule from Tuesday to Wednesday because of the availability of our team members. Hopefully you can make it then!_
