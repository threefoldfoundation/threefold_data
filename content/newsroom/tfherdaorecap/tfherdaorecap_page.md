This Monday, ThreeFold, in collaboration with [H.E.R DAO](https://www.her-dao.xyz/), orchestrated a meetup in Dar Es Salaam that brought together a group of more than 50 students, developers, and members of the tech community. The gathering unfolded as a platform for insights, discussions, and actionable steps aimed at fostering digital sovereignty and inclusive innovation in Tanzania.

### **Interactive Workshop and Technical Demos | Deploying a Sovereign Internet Infrastructure**

Kristof De Spiegeleer, co-founder of ThreeFold, shared key insights into deploying a sovereign Internet in Tanzania. He highlighted the necessity of such an infrastructure and outlined actionable steps for the community on how to connect capacity and build on top of this transformative Internet platform.

Kristof also presented how this vision will be brought to life in Tanzania through the Dunia Yetu initiative - A collaborative movement led by ThreeFold, in partnership with the Tanzanian ICT Commission, Holochain, and the Dar Es Salaam tech community, to reshape the digital landscape in Tanzania and East Africa.

### **Hands-On Demos**

Interested developers and tech-advanced attendees were treated to practical demonstrations of how to connect hardware to a sovereign Internet infrastructure, led by some members of the community and supported by Kristof.

<br>

The session continued with a demonstration of the deployment process for this Internet framework, enabling them to learn and better understand the process, while being able to discuss and ask questions. Some of the attendees were then onboarded with the manual and invited to join our various communication channels for support, as needed.

### **Empowering Diversity and Inclusivity with H.E.R. DAO, “If We Want The Future To Look Like Us, WE Have To Build It.”**

Tracey Bowen (founder) introduced H.E.R. DAO, a dynamic developer DAO with a strong commitment to championing diversity and inclusion in Web3. H.E.R. DAO focuses on increasing diversity in the blockchain ecosystem, especially empowering women that are not represented enough in the field. H.E.R. DAO's objective is to increase diversity in the blockchain ecosystem through hackathons, bootcamps, conferences, and grant programs.

<br>

Tracey also showcased how attendees could connect with the DAO's offerings, benefit from their educational resources (free online courses, scholarships, etc.) and contribute to the mission of fostering diversity and innovation while building products that generate revenue while enhancing equity for everyone.

We're looking forward to collaborating more with Tracey and H.E.R. DAO. In the meantime if you'd like to learn more, you can find info on H.E.R. DAO here : [her-dao.xyz](https://www.her-dao.xyz)
