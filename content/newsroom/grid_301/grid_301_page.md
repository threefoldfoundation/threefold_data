We have been, for some months, in testing mode on our ThreeFold Grid 3.X and today we are sharing **whatâ€™s new in TF Grid 3.0.1 â€“ and the path to mainnet!** ðŸš¨

<br/>

Including: improvements suggested for 3.x farming model, a web-based widget to simplify calculations, validator nodes, a DAO, and what we still need to for mainnet!
