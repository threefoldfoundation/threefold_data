Together with a group of tech community leaders and innovators from Dar Es Salaam, we have kicked off a project called Dunia Yetu (Our World, in Swahili).

<br/>

The primary goal of Dunia Yetu is to deliver a set of tools and a platform which will allow many thousands of coders in East Africa to create their own digital sovereign Internet. For now, it begins with the deployment of local ThreeFold infrastructure and a series of events and gatherings.
