Yesterday, Sam, Drew, and Kristof took us through all that’s been happening related to Mastodon and the Fediverse in recent weeks, how ThreeFold can support / is supporting, and what we as a community can do as well. Find the recording [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/mastodon-the-fediverse-community-call-recording/3522).

<br/>

It was quite an interactive session. There were some super interesting comments and questions – and we look forward to continuing the conversation about this evolving topic on [the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/c/threefold-grid-utilization/fediverse/).
