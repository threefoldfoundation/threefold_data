At ThreeFold, together with a beautiful ecosystem of partners, we are co-creating a peer-to-peer Internet that empowers equality, freedom, and sustainability.
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, we were always focused on building and utilizing [our own transactional blockchain](https://github.com/threefoldtech/rivine). We wanted to make sure we did it in the right way, upholding our values - but then we realized that the solution was already out there.
<br/>
<br/>
_Stellar is an open-source network for currencies and payments. Stellar makes it possible to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money - dollars, pesos, bitcoin, pretty much anything. It's designed so all the world's financial systems can work together on a single network._
<br/>
<br/>
_Stellar has no owner; if anything it's owned by the public. The software runs across a decentralized, open network and handles millions of transactions each day. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Stellar relies on blockchain to keep the network in sync, but the end-user experience is more like cash - Stellar is much faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient than typical blockchain-based systems._
<br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of collaboration, something we believe in heavily, we knew the right decision was to abandon our own transactional blockchain and to move our ThreeFold Token (TFT) to Stellar.
<br/>
<br/>

### Why did we choose Stellar?

* Technology-wise it's a very strong platform - energy-friendly & fast.
* There is good liquidity on the Stellar Network; it's super easy to go from XLM to TFT.
* By utilizing the Stellar Network, we are part of a large blockchain platform/network. There is good integration with other digital currencies.
* Perhaps most importantly, we share like-minded values.

The Stellar Network is supported by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF). From [their website](https://www.stellar.org/foundation), "SDF and Stellar seek to unlock the world's economic potential by making money more fluid, markets more open, and people more empowered."
<br/>
<br/>
The ThreeFold and Stellar Foundations have very aligned goals, particularly around empowerment of all people around the world - to create equal access to the Internet and to a global, inclusive financial system. Both solutions are built on open-source technology, both aim to unlock the world's economic potential, and most of all, both empower people in developing countries and all around the globe.
<br/>
<br/>
That is why ThreeFold is proud to be a part of the Stellar Network.
