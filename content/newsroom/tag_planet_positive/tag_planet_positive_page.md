Take a look at our three-part series to explore these efforts:

- [Pt I: ThreeFold on track to be planet-positive](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive/2097/3)
- [Pt II: Supporting initiatives to regenerate the planet](https://forum.threefold.io/t/supporting-initiatives-to-regenerate-the-planet/2110)
- [Pt III: Driving regeneration with Take Action Global](https://forum.threefold.io/t/driving-regeneration-with-tag/2120)

<br/>

*You can support a planet-positive Internet by becoming a farmer! All you have to do is connect capacity to the grid and you‚Äôre effortlessly contributing to the regeneration of our planet, as this model will allow all farms to become planet positive by default.*
