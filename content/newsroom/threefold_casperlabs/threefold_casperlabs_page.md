CasperLabs and ThreeFold have a shared belief that decentralization is needed in order to build a better tomorrow. According to [CasperLabs](https://casperlabs.io/en/company), decentralization is "how we will create more open, transparent, permissionless networks powered by people — paving the way for a new era of equitable innovation."
<br/>
<br/>
Today, ThreeFold is thrilled to announce a collaborative partnership with CasperLabs. Together, we will further CasperLabs' decentralization efforts while accelerating a collective mission and vision of more equally distributing global wealth and resources – doing so through creating more opportunity for people and enterprises around the world, without limits.

_"ThreeFold and CasperLabs share a commitment to making web3 environments more accessible to all developers," says Neil Kapoor of CasperLabs. "Now that Casper is live on mainnet, we look forward to collaborating with ThreeFold to deliver a truly scalable, secure and decentralized IT infrastructure for enterprise organizations building innovative, blockchain-based solutions."_
<br/>
<br/>

Through the partnership, developers and enterprises building on top of Casper technology will be able to choose to run on ThreeFold's [Peer-to-Peer Cloud](https://threefold.io/cloud) for storage and compute resources. This will enable them to achieve security and scalability beyond what the centralized cloud providers can offer today.
<br/>
<br/>
On a smaller scale, anyone will be able to contribute to Casper's blockchain security, resiliency, scalability and decentralization, by deploying a Casper Validator node on the ThreeFold Grid in just a few clicks. The ThreeFold deployment mechanism removes all technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes.

_From ThreeFold co-founder Adnan Fatayerji, "We are extremely excited about our partnership with CasperLabs. Their platform is designed with simplicity and scale to drive global adoption amongst enterprises and developers. ThreeFold fits perfectly as a decentralized substrate (storage and compute) to provide all Casper customers with a truly decentralized, secure, and scalable alternative to current cloud providers."_
