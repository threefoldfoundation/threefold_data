What a year it has been!

<br/>

"2022 was a year marked by significant steps on technology, big strides towards decentralization, a commitment to our values (planet, people, and authenticity), time well-spent on the ground, and strong contributions from the community."

<br/>

In [our 2022 Review](https://forum.threefold.io/t/heres-our-2022-review/3661), we go over the progress made within the ThreeFold ecosystem across different arenas: Grid, Farming, Technology, Decentralization, TFT, Partnerships, Team on the Ground, Mastodon, the Fediverse & ThreeFold, and Q4 Community Calls.

_Thanks to you all for being part of this journey, and Happy New Year! ❤️_
