*The below is an update from a summit we held here in Zanzibar this past weekend called the Africa Regenerative Futures Summit. It was a follow-up of [an event we hosted in July](https://youtu.be/GIBlmID7g5o?t=246&si=KYEExcPFHUCU7HKY). And we aim to continue to host this as a series of gatherings around OurWorld, ThreeFold, and other planet-first people-first projects and individuals who are supporting or want to support Tanzania and the African continent as a whole.*

<br>

On the 16th of November, we had a roundtable covering important relevant topics (Cyber Pandemic, AI, Quantum Computing, etc.) and explaining the core vision of OurWorld and ThreeFold in context to what is currently happening in today’s world as a whole.

<br>

Over the course of Friday and Saturday morning, we delved into an exciting array of projects, with a focus on experiencing two inspirational mornings that provided valuable insights into the current landscape of OurWorld and its affiliated initiatives.

On the fourth and final day, we spent time with some of our friends participants from Dar Es Salaam and Kenya to understand each others’ collective goals and put together a collaboration plan, which involves deploying ThreeFold infrastructure locally and working together in the coming months on developer sessions and hackathons. The team is really looking forward to supporting and working together with this community and we’ll [provide updates](https://forum.threefold.io/t/introducing-dunia-yetu/4147) as we have them.
