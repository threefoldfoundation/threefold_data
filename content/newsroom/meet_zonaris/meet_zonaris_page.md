Started by the Green Edge team, [Zonaris](https://www.zonaris.io/) is a decentralized node deployment platform built on top of the ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

“We host your nodes on reliable, decentralised architecture. We don't believe Web3 nodes should be hosted on Web2 architecture owned and controlled by a handful of trillion-dollar companies … Existing NaaS ("node-as-a-service") companies use the old AWS/Azure services for their nodes which undercuts a central plank of Web3, namely, decentralisation.”

<br/>

The team is hoping to hit 1,000 Streamr nodes on Zonaris soon, driving utilization on the grid – and will also be offering nodes of other projects in the coming months.
