As part of the TF Grid 3.11 release (now on testnet), farmers can now set an extra fee for their nodes, for having GPU or other special features enabled. This fee is in addition to the price of the capacity, and is paid in full to the farmer.

<br/>

By setting a custom price on a node, the node becomes dedicated â€“ which means it can no longer be shared by any other customers.
