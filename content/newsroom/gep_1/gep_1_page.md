🗳 **Action Requested: Grid Enhancement Proposal**

<br/>

Hi friends, particularly those in the farming community –

<br/>

As you many of you know by now, we came across a bug in the minting code which had a negative effect on some nodes on the TF Grid during last month's minting.

<br/>

First of all, we want to thank the ThreeFold community for the way they reached out to us in regards to this. 🙏

<br/>

These events sparked a discussion on the current uptime requirements and as a result of that, **we created [a forum post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/upgrade-proposal-for-minting-code-v3-2/2447) with a poll where the community can vote** on the changes as suggested.

<br/>

Please note that the poll will be closed on Friday March 18th at 8AM CET. If a minimum of 60% positive votes are achieved, we will implement these changes as soon as we can.

<br/>

All the best,

<br/>

ThreeFold Team
