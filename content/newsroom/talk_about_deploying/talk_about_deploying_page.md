Thanks to Drew for creating [this great resource](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-tell-people-about-deploying-workloads-on-the-threefold-grid/3662) for anyone in the community that wants to get the word out about deploying workloads on ThreeFold. Take a look, ask questions, offer suggestions and additions, and let’s use this information to bring more people to the community and more utilization to the grid.
