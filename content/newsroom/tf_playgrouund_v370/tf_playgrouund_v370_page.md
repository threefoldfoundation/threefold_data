The ThreeFold Playground makes it easy to build (deploy weblets) on top of the ThreeFold Grid. From Virtual Machines to Kubernetes to Presearch Nodes, CapRover, ownCloud, and more – in a truly decentralized environment!

<br/>

The team is constantly working on improving and evolving the experience. Take a look at [what’s new and next](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0/3315) for the TF Playground.
