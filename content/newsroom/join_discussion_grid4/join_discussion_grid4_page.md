We have been working on the plan for TF Grid 4.0 and are now pleased to open up the conversation now with the community.

<br/>

Some highlights: TF Grid 4.0 brings forward an updated farming economic system, the long-discussed Regional Internet Model, as well as 3Bot â€“ a feature familiar to those who have been around the project for a while.

For those who would like to be a part of the discussion, we invite you to [this group](https://t.me/+C-KhvHiblfo2ZWVh).
