Related to last week's Liquid news:
<br/>
<br/>
**Today, Liquid announced “the closing of a US$120,000,000 debt financing” from FTX Trading Ltd, owner and operator of top tier exchange FTX**, and “that they have entered good faith discussions in pursuit of further collaborative opportunities.”
<br/>
<br/>
While we cannot speculate on what these further collaborative opportunities might be and how they could impact tokens listed on Liquid, it is certainly good news for Liquid to have such support from FTX.
