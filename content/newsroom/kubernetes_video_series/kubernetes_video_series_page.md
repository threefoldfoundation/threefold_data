Jakub created a [mini video series about using Kubernetes on the ThreeFold grid](https://forum.threefold.io/t/kubernetes-on-threefold-mini-video-series/3831). It is suited mainly for beginners looking to deploy their first workload on the Grid using Kubernetes. 

<br/>

The three videos part of this series focus on :
- 1️⃣ The playground, initial setup & dashboard
- 2️⃣ The deployment of nginx
- 3️⃣ The replication & distribution on multiple nodes

<br/>

Check it out and don't forget to give him some feedback!

_Thanks a lot to Jakub for producing this helpful resource!_
