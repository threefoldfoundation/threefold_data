Together with the team’s efforts and testing support from the community, we are now ready to propose a new mainnet upgrade from TFGrid v3.6.1 to TFGrid v3.7.1!

<br/>

Farmers with active nodes are eligible to participate, and can vote in the [ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf/). Once logged in, click on "Account" and then "DAO” and the proposal will appear on your screen.

<br/>

We highly encourage all farmers to cast their vote! 25 yes votes are needed to pass this proposal, and voting ends this Sunday night.
