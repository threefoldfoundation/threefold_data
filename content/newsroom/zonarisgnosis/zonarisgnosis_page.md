After kicking off with Streamr, [Zonaris](https://zonaris.io/) has now launched 1-click non-custodial Gnosis validators running on top of the decentralized ThreeFold Grid.

<br/>

Head over to [zonaris.io/gnosis](https://www.zonaris.io/gnosis) to get started! The first 100 validators are only â‚¬1.

*Congratulations to the Zonaris team for launching their second project!*
