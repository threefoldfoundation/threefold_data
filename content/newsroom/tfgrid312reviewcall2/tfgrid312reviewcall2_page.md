Next Thursday August 24th at 5pm CEST, we will host a call (link [here](https://bit.ly/tfcommunitycall)) to bring an updated TF Grid 3.12 proposal to the table (based on the previous feedback) and get fresh input from the community.

<br/>

We will share the proposal ahead of the call.

<br/>

For those who are still interested, please take a look at [the recording](https://youtu.be/VcNZvp_PhPs) of the first call as well as [the notes](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-3-12-proposal-and-discussion/4031/16?u=gosam).
