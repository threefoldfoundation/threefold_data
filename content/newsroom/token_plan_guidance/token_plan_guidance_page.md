We have a good plan in place to stimulate token growth but we have some key decisions to make & we are creating a group to help us finalize. We have already invited / included a number of farmers, token holders, ambassadors, and outside industry experts – and now we want to open it up to the wider community.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in being a part of this guidance committee, please get in touch with @samtaggart on Telegram and he will ask some questions to ensure we get a well-rounded group of people.
<br/>
<br/>
Please reply by the end of today 6pm CET, if you'd like to be a part. A call will be scheduled for Friday or Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
Please take note of a few things:
<br/>
<br/>

- The plan WILL be with the best interest for the long-term growth of the token
- The plan WILL be in the best interest of farmers and token holders
- The plan WILL be in line with our values
