## Major ThreeFold News:

* Members of the ThreeFold team attended the **[World Blockchain Summit](https://mobile.twitter.com/threefold_io/status/1507009092165853185)** in Dubai. Over two days we exchanged with countless people and their reactions were unanimous – ThreeFold is undeniably one of the most exciting projects in the blockchain space. We’re excited to join many more events this year to drive the ThreeFold movement forward!

<br/>

* We’re collecting [farmer stories](https://forum.threefold.io/t/looking-for-farmer-stories-to-share-with-the-world/2398?u=hannahcordes) to **share about the people behind ThreeFold** – a globally diverse community united around the mission of building an open-source, peer-to-peer Internet, owned by humanity.

<br/>

* Only **8 [L2](https://forum.threefold.io/t/procedure-to-register-your-l2-validator-node/1864) and 3 [L0](https://forum.threefold.io/t/procedure-to-register-your-l0-validator-nodes/1866) validator spots remain**. We are grateful to know that the people behind the validators believe in a decentralized future and want to take part in a meaningful way.

### Technology Developments:
