### Community Updates:

* On the UAE Tech Podcast, ThreeFold **co-founder Weynand Kuijpers** explains how Threefold works in simple terms and why an Internet by the people for the people is so important. Tune in [here](https://www.albawaba.com/business/uae-tech-podcast-threefold-layer-zero-and-peoples-internet-1477554)!

<br/>

* Give [this conversation](https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-farmers-journey-through-yielding-defi-nodes-and-expanding-the-grid-with-threefold-a70a3e3b98ea) between Kyle Ellicott and Scott Yeager a read. The two cover a lot of topics – from Scott’s **experience as a DIY farmer** and his **journey into ThreeFold** to advice for fellow farmers.

<br/>

* Some of the team and members of the ThreeFold ecosystem finished two weeks of gatherings on the Nile to educate and evangelize. With **new advocates for the ThreeFold movement** (e.g. farmers, investors) by our side, we’ll continue to **build a better future** through the Internet of Internets.

<br/>

* We just launched our **new ThreeFold Podcast**. Listen to the first four episodes [here](https://anchor.fm/threefoldpodcast)!

### ThreeFold Grid: 

* To learn how to verify your 3Nodes’ payouts on Stellar Blockchain, read [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-verify-your-3nodes-payments/2864?u=hannahcordes)!

<br/>

* If you ordered a Titan but have not yet received it, **[please make sure you have created your V3 farm](https://forum.threefold.io/t/creating-your-v3-farm-required-for-open-unshipped-orders/2144)** to ensure quick delivery. Global Titan shipping is ongoing in all regions! *Our support team is available via threefold.io or on the ThreeFold Connect app with any questions.*

<br/>

* And if you're an existing farmer, we urge you to **migrate 3Nodes to V3 asap**. It just takes a few steps, [the migration process](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes) is quite simple and fast.

<br/>

Until next week, ThreeFolders!  🙌
