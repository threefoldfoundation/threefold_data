There’s no question that climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest threats facing humanity today. If we care at all about future generations and the health of our planet, we have no choice but to address these threats, and fast. That’s why one of our biggest aims is to lower the energy usage of our digital lives. But ThreeFold is taking not just a sustainable approach, we’re setting the plan for a planet positive Internet.
<br/>
<br/>
Recently, we released information on how our infrastructure saves up-to-90% on energy consumption compared to existing models. We achieve this mainly thanks to an extremely efficient storage system and the concept of a Digital Twin.
<br/>
<br/>
From [a storage standpoint](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold__energy_savings_storage), we reduce energy by avoiding copies, implementing a multi-layer system, not using fast disks, through read/write caching, and more. With [Digital Twin](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold__energy_savings_digital_twin), we have taken a very different approach to how we exist in today’s digital world. Rather than existing 100 times in a huge system of client-server architecture, now we exist only once. We believe that we can run 25 Digital Twins with [the same energy](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold__bulb_comparison_twin) as used by one light bulb.
<br/>
<br/>
Saving energy is one thing, but there will still be remaining energy. This needs to be offset by carbon credits. Now, in order to regenerate our planet, we [work together with Take Action Global](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold__carbon_negative) to let students farm carbon credits. This has the potential to offset energy usage 100% by the end of 2021, and we have, as an aim to take 2x more carbon out of the air than we put in.
<br/>
<br/>
Our planet needs better solutions across industries. No more talking. Now is the time to act.
