## Major ThreeFold News:

* Last week, Gulf Land Property hosted the  **Paradise Hills Award Gala with over 160 people**  including home owners, contractors and supporting project developers. During the Gala, ThreeFold’s  **Adnan Fatayerji and Weynand Kuijpers**  had the chance to present ThreeFold to the audience with an overwhelmingly positive response and support. Moreover, the two co-founders accepted  **an award for ThreeFold**  as an  **integral technology partner**  of Paradise Hills Development and establishing the [world's first community-driven cloud](https://threefold.io/news/post/paradise_hills/).

<br/>

* ThreeFold co-founder  **Adnan Fatayerji**  joined the [BlockHash Podcast](https://youtu.be/wu-vf1H-zQ0) to share all about ThreeFold and to discuss decentralization. It’s a great interview,  **covering all ThreeFold essentials** . Well done, Adnan!

### Community updates:

* **Mik**  from Canada shared about his experiences as a DIY farmer and how he is  **leading the way**  by providing  **big-time support**  for the ThreeFold Farming community. Watch the inspiring conversation between Mik and Sam [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE5E1mCVdqk&t=2s). *If you’re a community member interested in sharing your story in a similar format, let us know in the comments below [this post](https://forum.threefold.io/t/looking-for-farmer-stories-to-share-with-the-world/2398?u=hannahcordes).*

### Technology Developments:

### ThreeFold Grid: 

* In a [new Grid Enhancement Proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-farming-start-price-april-2022/2585?u=hannahcordes), the Grid Council proposed the **farming start price of 0.08 USD in April**. Thank you all for voting, this GEP has **passed with 89%** of our community voting in favour, meaning the farming start price for April will be 0.08 USD. Please remember that the minting payout for March 2022 will be executed on the 8th of April instead of the 5th of April.

<br/>

* **Have you migrated your 3Nodes from V2 to V3 yet?** If not, please do it asap as **it’s our collective responsibility** to fully bring the ThreeFold Grid to its latest version. Also, it’s crucial for you to log in V3 farming rewards, so finish the migration process via ThreeFold Connect as explained [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes).

Until next time, ThreeFolders! 🙌
