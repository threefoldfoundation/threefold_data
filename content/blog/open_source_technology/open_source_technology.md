## Open source technology ensures the knowledge enters the public domain, protects information sharing and further innovation possibilities

### ThreeFold open source components overview

The following components are used to build the ThreeFold Grid and deliver unequivalent benefits in power optimization, performance & scalability.

- [Jumpscale  = Automation Framework](https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_threebot)
- [Distributed OS = Zero-OS](https://github.com/zero-os)
- [Neutral Identity Management](https://github.com/itsyouonline)
- [Solving the Blockchain Dilemma](https://github.com/rivine)

### Open Source Architecture Components

**Zero-OS**: A truly distributed OS managed by ThreeFold's Zero-OS controller. It is a very different type of OS that removes the need for local filesystems, volume drivers, local packages, software installations and terminals (like ssh, ...). The Zero OS Components consists of:
- Zero-OS core (replacement of systemd, kernel boots this first process)
- Zero-OS filesystem (virtual filesystem for Zero-OS, OS files are not installed on local storage)
- Zero-OS vDisk (virtual Disks running 0-OS FS)
- Zero-OS cockpit (AYS - self-healing, jumpscale portal, restAPI, Telegram interface)
- Zero-OS CLI - command line tools

**Zero Storage** (part of Zero-OS): An easy to use and ultra reliable storage system. It is dense and environmentally friendly. It can make use of conventional disks for storage and manage multi data centers with a single namespace. It is not based on replication and makes backup obsolete. Even in the unlikely case of a node going down, data remains available. Quite a revolution for self-healing IT systems. 
- One IT expert can now manage 100 PB of data.
- 5PB in 1 rack for archive
- Super scale out 50+ PB
- Ultra high performance 100-250.000 IOPS per node (depends on HW)
- Makes storage space efficient - 2-3x better than alternatives (NAS & Archive)

**Cockpit** (Also known as Jumpscale / At Your Service): Was created to enable anyone to design and deploy virtual datacenters in minutes. It is a free of charge software and runs on any Zero-OS to eliminate layers of complexity. Making use of automated technology, you are always assisted.
- Comprehensive: human readable, easy to learn format
- No more complicated technical oriented configuration files
- No networking, virtualization or storage expertise required
- Concentrate on business process automation, not IT
- With ready-to-deploy blueprints available off-the-shelf
- Blueprint marketplaces
- Manage full IT lifecycles leveraging container technology
- Grow, add, distribute, and destroy capacity when needed
- No downtime: Change and upgrades are immediate

**ThreeFold Chain (Rivine)**: The sustainable proof of stake blockchain created by ThreeFold that combined with other components tackles the blockchain dilemma.
- Smart contracts
- Low transaction fees
- Supports atomic swaps
- Used to reserve capacity on the TF Grid

**ItsYou.Online**: To enable a neutral identity management system that is safe from hacking or compromising (e.g. Blockchain proof-of-work). It features the following characteristics.
- Real Peer-to-Peer distribution
- Blockchain protected
