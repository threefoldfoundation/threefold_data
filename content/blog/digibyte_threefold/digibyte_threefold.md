The [DigiByte Foundation](https://digibytefoundation.io/) and the [ThreeFold Foundation](https://threefold.io) are aligned – both focused on values, working towards their visions and missions in creating a truly decentralized, equal, and sustainable world that empowers humanity. Doing good for the planet is at the core of both organizations' DNA. 

Today, DigiByte and ThreeFold are pleased to officially announce their collaborative partnership.

DigiByte and ThreeFold will work together on developer and user projects on the ThreeFold Grid. The DigiByte developer community, and anyone interested in contributing to the DigiByte Blockchain, is being invited to use a more decentralized and affordable cloud computing capacity. Developers can now deploy their DigiByte nodes and IT workloads on the ThreeFold Grid with an autonomous execution via [Smart Contracts for IT](https://sdk.threefold.io/#/smart_contract).  

Further, community members are also being invited to explore possibilities in using the ThreeFold Grid’s capacity for their own personal computing needs and projects.  Anyone interested in being a node operator in the DigiByte Blockchain using the ThreeFold Grid would be highly encouraged to get started in a few steps following [the documentation](https://forum.threefold.io/t/how-to-deploy-a-digibyte-node-with-your-3bot-in-5-steps/379).  

The ThreeFold team is very proud to welcome The DigiByte Foundation to the [Conscious Internet Alliance](https://consciousinternet.org) initiative led by ThreeFold, where together with many other planet and human-centric projects, they will collaborate on making our global Internet neutral again. 

### About DigiByte:
[DigiByte](https://digibyte.io/) is a rapidly-growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence with one of the most active communities in the Crypto and Blockchain space

The DigiByte Foundation is a volunteer-managed organization that operates in a non-profit way. They protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower DigiByte and its community to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world. 

### About ThreeFold:
ThreeFold has developed the largest and most advanced peer-to-peer Internet grid in the world.  They launched the ThreeFold Grid V2.0 in  April 2020 – a  more performant, private & secure, affordable, and sustainable solution than centralized cloud and internet providers. 

With a collective and incentivized ecosystem of Farmers (independent Internet capacity providers) around the globe, the [ThreeFold Grid](https://threefold.io/capacity.html)  is now open for developers to build on top of it,  and users can now benefit from all the advantages of the ThreeFold Grid.

The ThreeFold Foundation aims to empower a more equal, autonomous (decentralized) and sustainable world, and does so  by providing the necessary peer-to-peer technologies and infrastructure to the world, while incentivizing growth in developing regions.
