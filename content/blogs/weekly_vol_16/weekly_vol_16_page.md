On another note: Fake accounts are currently inviting people to participate in airdrop campaigns under the name of ThreeFold. Unfortunately, scams are very common in the crypto space. In order to protect yourself, please treat PMs with care and read this [article](https://medium.com/the-capital/cryptocurrency-airdrop-scams-how-to-spot-them-and-avoid-being-a-victim-38172ad91b2d) on **how to spot scams**.
