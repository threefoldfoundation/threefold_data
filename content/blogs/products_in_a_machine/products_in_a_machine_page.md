In an ever-expanding and evolving digital world, our relationship with the Internet is generally underdiscussed. We've come to rely on platforms that promise connection, information, and entertainment. Yet, there are cracks in the system and massive trade offs for all of us, the "users." Let's pause for a moment and consider, is today's Internet truly serving us?

<br/>

(tl;dr The answer is "No.")

## The Rise & Fall of Platforms

The world of digital platforms can leave us feeling a bit deflated. We invest time and effort in creating content and building our online presence across platforms, only to see them come and go – either in terms of popularity or existance. Years of efforts can go down the drain in an instant. And the introduction of new platforms means we feel almost pressured to create new profiles yet again. Take Threads, for example, recently released by Meta. I, personally, have not downloaded the app or created a profile myself. Nor do I plan to.

## Algorithmic Shifts & Manipulation

Algorithms, like shifting weather, change direction without warning. What used to be familiar suddenly feels like a puzzle we can't solve. Further, algorithms on social media and other platforms are designed to keep us engaged. They show us content that's likely to keep us scrolling and clicking. This can lead to addictive behaviors, with us spending more time on platforms than we initially intended.

## Platform Redundancy

Why, in this digital age, do we have countless platforms doing essentially the same thing? It's as if we're at a party with multiple dance floors, all playing the same music. This fragmented landscape demands our memory's acrobatics as we juggle passwords, navigate different interfaces, and figure out where our friends are hanging out. A simpler, unified experience seems a distant dream.

## Products in a Machine

We pour our creativity and stories into platforms, only to realize we don't truly own them. Our content, our data, our followers – they belong to the platform. It's like building a sandcastle at the beach, but it washes away with the tide. The digital space, which once held the promise of empowerment, has subtly transformed us into products within a larger system.

## Decentralization: Reclaiming Digital Sovereignty

Imagine a digital world where you're the true owner of your data and content, where your digital footprint isn't erased by platform shifts. A space where the power to shape the experience is in your hands, where you're not a product but a participant in a collaborative journey.

This reimagined Internet isn't a dream; it's an evolving reality. Decentralization represents a paradigm shift – a chance to reclaim our digital autonomy. We need to foster an environment where platforms don't dictate, but rather, serve as tools shaped by the collective. This is a call to action, a reminder that a more inclusive, user-centric Internet is within reach.

The Internet has always been a canvas for human connection and creativity. Let's paint a picture where we're not just contributors but true owners, where we're not lost in a labyrinth but are the architects of our digital landscape. Let's embrace a decentralized Internet, because we deserve an Internet that truly serves us – the people.
