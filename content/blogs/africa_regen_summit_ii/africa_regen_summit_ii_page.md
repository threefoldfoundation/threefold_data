In 2023, we had the pleasure of hosting two summits in Zanzibar – one in [July](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=246&si=KYEExcPFHUCU7HKY&v=GIBlmID7g5o&feature=youtu.be) and another in [November](https://www.threefold.io/newsroom/africa-regen-ii/), named the Africa Regenerative Future Summit. These events brought together leading innovators and investors committed to advancing human flourishing, with a specific emphasis on science and technology shaping the trajectory of Africa's future.

<br>

During the inaugural summit in July, Zanzibar's President, Dr. Hussein Mwinyi, honored us with his presence. In a formal declaration, he publicly expressed the government's dedication to establishing a digital free zone, a locally-owned Internet infrastructure, and an incubator to support young local innovators – all in collaboration with ThreeFold – and their commitment to the ICT sector as a whole.

<br>

The second summit saw the birth of Dunia Yetu (meaning "Our World" in Swahili), a collaborative movement forged in partnership with a cohort of tech developers and innovators from Dar Es Salaam. This initiative is driven by a shared commitment to reshape the digital landscape in Tanzania and Africa. Its goals include empowering coders, fostering economic development, and constructing a sovereign, autonomous digital ecosystem for a more promising digital future. 

<br>

Looking ahead to 2024, our vision includes a continued series of gatherings focused on OurWorld, ThreeFold, and other projects and individuals prioritizing a planet-first, people-first approach to support Tanzania and the broader African continent.
