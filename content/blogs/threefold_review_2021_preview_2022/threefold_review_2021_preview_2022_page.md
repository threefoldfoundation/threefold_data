It was an important year for ThreeFold, with huge developments on the ThreeFold Grid, the continued expansion of the grid by farmers, key partnerships, and more – all setting up for a strong 2022.

<br/>

Let’s take a quick look back at the year that was.

### The ThreeFold Grid

In January we launched ThreeFold Grid 2.4 on Mainnet and evolved it through version 2.8. In September, we launched ThreeFold Grid 3.0 on testnet and just this week, we launched TF Grid 3.0 on mainnet, with limited capacity for now.

<br/>

ThreeFold Grid 3 brings a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the ThreeFold Grid and makes for a much simpler user experience for farmers and grid users.

<br/>

The starting point ThreeFold Grid 3:

### Notable Tech Developments

Other new developments on the tech side included [QSFS](https://threefold.io/news/post/qsfs_intro/) (Quantum Safe Storage System), [TF Chain](https://threefold.io/blog/tf_chain/), Smart Contracts and more (take a look at the new [tech section](https://threefold.io/tech) we launched with the new threefold.io this year and of course [our knowledge base](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/technology/threefold__technology)).

### The ThreeFold Token (TFT)

2021 was all about bringing TFT to more chains and making TFT more accessible, with the [BSC integration](https://threefold.io/news/post/bsc_update_news/), TF Chain, and [1inch](https://threefold.io/news/post/tft_1inch/).

### ThreeFold Farming

Today, the ThreeFold Grid is live in [57 countries](https://explorer.threefold.io) with more than 1,450 Nodes online. Thanks to all the Farmers who both built or bought and connected 3Nodes!

<br/>

In 2021, we introduced a [certified farming program](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__certified_farming) and [farming rewards 3.0](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold/#/tfgrid/farming/threefold__farming_reward) which will apply from ThreeFold Grid 3.1 onwards (end Jan). We also established [weekly 3Node updates](https://forum.threefold.io/c/farming/nodeshop-pre-order-faq/59) to keep you in the loop at all times.

### Partnerships

Throughout 2021, we announced key partnerships with [ownCloud](https://threefold.io/news/post/owncloud_threefold/), [DigiThree Labs](https://threefold.io/news/post/digithree/), [CasperLabs](https://threefold.io/news/post/threefold_casperlabs/) and many more. Most recently, two of these partnerships were featured in the news, [TAG](https://martechseries.com/technology/threefold-and-take-action-global-partner-to-bring-internet-access-to-1-billion-people-across-the-globe/) and [Computecoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-12-21/helping-africa-go-digital-a-metaverse-startup-is-working-with-an-ngo-to-expand-digital-infrastructure-in-africa). All of these will be launched in 2022.

## 2022 Preview (Q1)

In the first part of 2022, we are launching our grid.

<br/>

### The ThreeFold Token

Now is the time to [buy TFT](https://library.threefold.me/info/threefold#/tokens/how_to_buy)! (Please take a look at the launch plan above.)

<br/>

In 2022, our goal for the ThreeFold Token is to be available at as many entry points as possible. We’re planning integrations with many ecosystems like Cosmos to achieve great networking effects for the money networks. There will be discounts for Utilization based on pre-purchasing of TFT, and more.

## Wrapping Things Up

There’s no other project out there like ThreeFold. TF Grid 3 is here, the grid is continuously growing across the world, and this collective effort is uniquely positioned to truly decentralize the Internet. Remember: ThreeFold is inevitable.

<br/>

So, here we go! You can expect many more updates soon on what was covered above. And may the year 2022 be full of health, happiness and opportunities for all of us!

<br/>

Please be reminded we are a decentralized movement, we need your help to let us all “BE THE INTERNET.” Become a farmer, register for a validator, contribute to our movement, develop a solution on top of TF Grid … If you’re not sure how to help out but want to, please get in touch on [our two-way chat](https://t.me/threefold) or here on the forum.
