At the heart of ThreeFold’s mission is the benefit of the people & our planet. We aim to have a positive impact in the space of technology while keeping our ecological footprint low. Saving a maximum of energy has always been on our agenda. Now, with the rising bills of our farmers making it harder for them to keep on supporting the project, it became an even greater priority.  

<br/>

## Rising Energy Prices 

Energy prices have been on steady rise globally because of increasing costs of energy production, high demand, and the depletion of traditional energy sources such as oil and natural gas as primary drivers. However, the Russian-Western standoff due to the invasion of Ukraine has produced an [unprecedented increase in energy prices](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/impact-war-ukraine-energy-prices-consequences-firms-financial-performance), especially in Europe. 

<br/>

Some statistics:
* UK - Household energy bills [increased by 54% in April 2022](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9491/), and a further increase of 20% is expected in April 2023.
* USA - Consumers paid [14.3% more for electricity](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjHt5D4t-_8AhUxUKQEHcUxCXcQFnoECA8QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utilitydive.com%2Fnews%2Felectricity-prices-inflation-consumer-price-index%2F640656%2F&usg=AOvVaw1dL-3vVXBjEqA0wklxlmUt) last year on average.
* France - As of February 2023, [electricity prices may rise by 15%](https://www.thelocal.fr/20220914/french-pm-to-present-measures-to-limit-energy-bills-in-2023/).

<br/>

These rising energy costs have a significant impact on the economy, affecting inflation and driving up the cost of goods and services.

<br/>

## Reducing Our Bills & Our Impact on the Environment

Given the increasing cost of energy, it is more important than ever to adopt responsible energy use practices. Simple measures like turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using energy-efficient appliances, and properly insulating homes can make a big difference in reducing energy consumption and lowering bills. 

<br/>

By reducing energy waste, individuals and businesses can not only save money, but also help protect the environment and preserve natural resources for future generations. The world’s energy resources are finite, and the increasing demand for energy is putting pressure on the environment. By adopting responsible energy use practices, we can reduce our carbon footprint, decrease our dependence on non-renewable energy sources, and preserve the planet for future generations.

<br/>

Saving energy is important for the planet as it can have a positive impact on the environment and the economy. Some of the key benefits of energy conservation are:

<br/>

* **Reduces greenhouse gas emissions:** 
    * By reducing the amount of energy we consume, we also reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by power plants, which are a major contributor to climate change.
* **Saves natural resources:** 
    * Conserving energy helps to conserve our limited natural resources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which are used to generate electricity.
* **Lowers energy costs:** 
    * By using energy more efficiently, we can lower our energy bills, saving money and reducing our overall energy costs.
* **Improves energy security:** 
    * By reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy, we can improve our energy security and reduce the risks associated with energy shortages and price spikes.
* **Creates jobs:** 
    * The development and implementation of energy-efficient technologies and practices can create jobs in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors.

<br/>

While it has been known for a long time that [consuming less energy meant a smaller ecological footprint](https://www.saveonenergy.com/green-energy/save-energy-go-green/), most people weren’t very motivated to do so. However, once their wallets started feeling the price increase, people became increasingly aware & careful of their energy consumption. So, in a way, while it is not a great thing for our economies, the rising energy prices are doing a good thing for the planet.

## Energy Usage of Nodes

The energy usage of a node in a network depends on various factors such as the type of node, its hardware specifications, and the workload it is handling. Generally, nodes that perform more intensive computations and have more advanced hardware specifications will consume more energy compared to basic nodes.

<br/>

For example, nodes used in cryptocurrency mining operations are known to consume large amounts of energy due to the intensive computations they perform. On the other hand, simple nodes used for basic network functions such as routing or data storage may consume less energy.

<br/>

It is important to note that the energy consumption of a node can also be influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, network congestion, and power supply efficiency. By optimizing these factors, it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a node and minimize its environmental impact.

<br/>

## ThreeFold 3Node Servers

ThreeFold is a decentralized internet infrastructure that utilizes a network of nodes (referred to 3Nodes on our grid) to provide computing resources and data storage. Farmers can farm capacity for the ThreeFold Grid by building their own server and hosting Zero-OS on it, or by buying and running a preconfigured device. 

<br/>

In general, a 3Node cluster is expected to consume less energy compared to traditional server clusters, due to its focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. However, the exact energy usage will depend on the hardware specifications of the nodes, the workload they are handling, and the energy-saving measures implemented. It’s important to note that even a machine with nothing running on top of it consumes energy and brings a cost to farmers.

## ThreeFold WOL Feature Comes as Part of Our Farmerbot

Wake-on-LAN (WOL) is a feature in computer hardware that allows a network administrator to power on a computer remotely. The feature works by sending a special "magic packet" to the target computer, which contains the Media Access Control (MAC) address of the network adapter. The network adapter is programmed to recognize the magic packet and use it to initiate the power-on process.

<br/>

Wake-on-LAN is useful for remotely accessing a computer that is turned off, as it allows the computer to be powered on without physically pressing the power button. This feature is commonly used for remote administration and maintenance tasks, as well as for remotely accessing a computer for work or entertainment purposes.

<br/>

Wake-on-LAN requires specific hardware and software support, including a network adapter that supports the feature, a motherboard that enables the feature in the BIOS, and an operating system that supports WOL. Additionally, the computer must be connected to a network that supports WOL, and the feature must be enabled in the network adapter's settings.

<br/>

The community has been asking for an energy-saving solution for quite a while and we had been looking for one.  It took some time, as this was not the only topic that needed our team’s attention, and we had obstacles along the route to designing this solution, including limited funding and needful adjustments.
 
<br/>

We had been working on a WOL feature for power-saving set up directly on the chain, but it turned out to be a dead end. Instead of an independent WOL feature, our dev team started from scratch with [a new idea](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-power-management-feature-for-3-8-1/3721)! We are now very close to delivering a solution: A [Farmerbot ](https://github.com/threefoldtech/farmerbot/issues/1)that uses WOL to switch nodes on and off when needed! 

<br/>

Farmers will be able to define their configuration in an easy markdown format. The Farmerbot will check which nodes can be turned off or not. Farmers will be able to personalize this feature according to their farm’s own needs and preferences.  

<br/>

## Conclusion

Saving energy is crucial for the planet and has numerous positive impacts on the environment, economy, and society. By taking steps to conserve energy, we can help to reduce our environmental impact, lower energy costs, improve energy security, and create jobs in the clean energy sector. 

<br/>

Having a power-saving feature for ThreeFold nodes is one of our priorities. Together with the community, we agree that this is a pressing issue we need to solve. Our main incentive is to respect our engagement to be a sustainable network that puts the planet first. Supporting our farmers to get through difficult times financially is an extra one.
