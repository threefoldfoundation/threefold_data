### ThreeFold Grid:Â 

* In aÂ [new Grid Enhancement Proposal](https://forum.threefold.io/t/gep-farming-start-price-april-2022/2585?u=hannahcordes), the Grid Council proposed theÂ **farming start price of 0.08 USD in April**. Thank you all for voting, this GEP has **passed with 89%**Â of our community voting in favour, meaning the farming start price for April will be 0.08 USD. Please remember that the minting payout for March 2022 will be executed on the 8th of April instead of the 5th of April.
