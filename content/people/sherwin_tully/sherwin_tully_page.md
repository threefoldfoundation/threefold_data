Support Team Lead: I bring to the ThreeFold circle years of support experience having facilitated markets across Advertising & Design and E-commerce platforms. With the evolution of technology, I was introduced to a peer-to-peer, decentralized Internet & cloud infrastructure. 

I manage the whole nine yards of support and when I am not being a digital nomad, I love the sound of music and the freedom of a happy camper.
