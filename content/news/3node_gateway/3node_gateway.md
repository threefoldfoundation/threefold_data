"A 3node becomes a gateway when a Threefold farmer adds a public IP address to the node itself on the Threefold Dashboard. In doing so, the IP address is then handed over to the base operating system of the node itself. The IP address can then be used in the overall functions of the TF Grid."

You can configure your 3Nodes to become 'gateway nodes' in a few simple steps. Find out how by watching [Drew's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axvKipK7MQM&feature=youtu.be) about it, or by reading [Mik's summary](https://forum.threefold.io/t/what-is-a-3node-gateway-how-can-i-configure-a-3node-as-a-gateway-node/3766) of the video - or doing both!
