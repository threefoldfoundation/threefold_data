We held [a community call](https://forum.threefold.io/t/april-2023-tf-grid-4-community-call-recording/3896) a few days ago to discuss TF Grid 4.0. While we encourage you to watch [the full recording](https://youtu.be/7OwE3BPKJXk) to catch up with everything, we thought it would be beneficial to share a series of posts diving into specific topics explored during the call:
