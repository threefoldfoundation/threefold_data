In case you missed it:

Weynand appeared on [the UAE Tech Podcast](https://www.albawaba.com/business/uae-tech-podcast-threefold-layer-zero-and-peoples-internet-1477554) to explain how ThreeFold works in layman's terms and the importance of a "People's Internet."

<br/>

Sacha joined [Mainstay Digital](https://mainstaydigital.com/verticals/macro-visions/macro-visions-doing-to-the-internet-what-bitcoin-did-to-money-with-sacha-obeegadoo/) to discuss how ThreeFold is doing to the Internet what Bitcoin did to money.

<br/>
