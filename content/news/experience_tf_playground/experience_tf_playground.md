Build in a truly decentralized environment with the TF Playground, home to more than 10 (and counting) easy-to-deploy weblets – from Virtual Machines and Kubernetes to CapRover, ownCloud, and Presearch. A sandbox of limitless possibilities awaits for the open source builders of a decentralized tomorrow.

<br/>

As a decentralized project, we encourage the community to get involved in spreading the word about what’s possible on the TF Grid – with people in your circles, on social media, etc. Together we build. 🙏

Have ideas for getting the word out? Have questions or need resources? Please open a topic on [the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) and we’ll solve it together.
