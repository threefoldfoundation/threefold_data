As yesterday was largely focused on questions from the community, we'll plan another call in a couple of weeks to share more proactively current plans and priorities, the opportunities in front of us right now, why we believe the token price will turn around, and most importantly why what we’re building is so important for the future of the planet and humanity. 🙏
