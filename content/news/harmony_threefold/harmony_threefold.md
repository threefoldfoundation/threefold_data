[Harmony](https://www.harmony.one) and the [ThreeFold Foundation](https://threefold.io) are aligned in their focus on empowering an equal and fair world. Doing good for the planet and humanity is at the core of both organizations' DNA. Today, Harmony and ThreeFold are pleased to officially announce their collaborative partnership.
<br/>
<br/>
Harmony and ThreeFold will work together on developer and user projects on the [ThreeFold Grid](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/grid_why) and [Pangaea](https://docs.harmony.one/pangaea/). Harmony’s developer community, and anyone interested in contributing to their Blockchain and being a validator within the Harmony staking ecosystem, is being invited to use a more decentralized, performant and affordable [Peer-to-Peer Cloud](https://cloud.threefold.io/) solution brought by ThreeFold.
<br/>
<br/>
Developers can now deploy their nodes and any IT workloads on Pangaea and the ThreeFold Grid with an autonomous execution via [Smart Contracts for IT](https://library.threefold.me/info/sdk/#/smart_contract).  Anyone interested in being a node operator, as a validator, in the Harmony Blockchain using the ThreeFold Grid, is invited to get started in a few steps following this [documentation](https://forum.threefold.io/t/setting-up-a-harmony-node-on-the-threefold-grid/476).
<br/>
<br/>
From ThreeFold Co-Founder Adnan Fatayerji,
<br/>
<br/>
*"We’re super excited about our partnership with Harmony. Their approach to decentralization of applications and transactions perfectly couples with our approach of trying to bring an inclusive Internet. Together we will form a big powerhouse for positive change in this world."*
<br/>
<br/>
ThreeFold and Harmony look forward to the further development of this collaboration.

### About Harmony

[Harmony](https://www.harmony.one) is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Its protocol has achieved secure and random state sharding, being the first sharded Proof of Stake on production. Harmony's Mainnet supports thousands of nodes in multiple shards, producing blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The network's staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics - Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) which reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators.

### About ThreeFold

[ThreeFold](https://threefold.io) has developed the largest and most advanced peer-to-peer Internet grid in the world.  They launched the [ThreeFold Grid](https://explorer.grid.tf/) V2.0 in  April 2020 – a  more performant, private & secure, affordable, and sustainable solution than centralized cloud and internet providers. 
<br/>
<br/>
With a collective and incentivized ecosystem of Farmers (independent Internet capacity providers) around the globe, ThreeFold Grid - largest peer-to-peer Internet grid on earth, is now open for developers to build on top of it,  and users can now benefit from all the advantages of the ThreeFold Grid.
<br/>
<br/>
The ThreeFold Foundation aims to empower a more equal, autonomous, decentralized,  and sustainable internet and does so  by providing the necessary peer-to-peer technologies and infrastructure to individuals and creators, while incentivizing growth in developing regions.
