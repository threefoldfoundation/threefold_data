## About

India Blockchain Alliance (IBA) was established in 2018 with the purpose of mutual assistance in the field of business development, networking, cooperation and a joint approach to defending the interests of the members of the alliance. It also seeks to raise awareness of the importance of the blockchain technology among the professional and lay public, and, therefore, organizes various events and training courses. It also cooperates with the government authorities in the field of the relevant legislation.  IBA is a key player in the process of creating a setting that will transform India into a global blockchain destination. The members will work harmoniously and in unison for the benefit of the individual and collective business development of blockchain companies.  

IBA is a not-for-profit organisation that promotes evidence-based adoption of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) across the public and private sectors.  Our alliance is drawn from the worlds of Blockchain, Academia, Information Technology, Computer Science, regulators and policymakers in the field of distributed ledger technologies. IBA is a close-knit network of experts and organisations connecting policymakers, academics, blockchain engineers, venture capitalists and visionaries.
