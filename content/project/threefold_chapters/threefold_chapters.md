# ThreeFold Chapters

Chapters are independent groups of people and organizations who are representing and promoting the ThreeFold Foundation, Ecosystem & Technology to the general public and assist newcomers to onboard within the TF ecosystem. Chapters themselves may also be engaged in farming, product development and investment within the ThreeFold Ecosystem. In order to start a TF Chapter one needs to become a TF Ambassador.

If you feel inspired to create your own chapter, please connect with the TF Ambassador Admin Team to get started! ([Owen Kemp](http://t.me/OwenKemp), [Gregor Sideris](http://t.me/Gregsideris), [Simin Gerards](http://t.me/simings), Nisha Grimes or [Olivia Jurado](http://t.me/juradoo))
