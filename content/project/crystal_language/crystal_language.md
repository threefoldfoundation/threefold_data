## About

It started out, like many things at [Manas.Tech](https://manas.tech/), as an experiment. Easy-to-write languages used to mean that you had to sacrifice speed. And getting fast meant enduring difficult syntax. So it began with asking ourselves: “What if we didn’t have to choose one or the other”, “what if we could compile Ruby?”. It turned out that it worked, so we decided to turn that experiment into an actual project and give it our best shot. It is our pride and joy: time and time again, we find that it is delightful to write code in Crystal, and that it outperforms everything else out there.

## Mission

Easy to write languages used to mean that you had to sacrifice speed. And getting fast meant enduring difficult syntax. Crystal means no longer having to choose: a programming language that adjusts to the needs of the programmer and the computer: easy to learn and code, but very performant and typesafe. The best of both worlds.

## Impact

Crystal is easy to write, which makes it easy to learn: that gives developers a short ramp-up time, and beginners can get things running in a very short time. Crystal is also super fast: it is used by scientists to run genome sequencing faster than ever before, and that helps save lives, save resources and, being so user-friendly, it saves them time in costly and tedious maintenance.

## Powered by ThreeFold

Crystal is a project of Manas.Tech, built along the years with the support of the community and Manas’ own: we match the contributions of the community to double every dollar’s impact. But it means that a great deal of effort goes, not only into developing the language, but also into trying to get funding. ThreeFold’s contribution allows our team to focus on doing what we do best, and enables us to dedicate more full-time engineers to accelerate Crystal’s development.

<!-- ## Support this project

Crystal Programming Language is included in ThreeFold’s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet, humanity and the ThreeFold Grid.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
Each project on the TDE benefits from TFT fund allocations. You can buy TFT's and support Crystal Programming Language, and the growth of a new Conscious Internet.
