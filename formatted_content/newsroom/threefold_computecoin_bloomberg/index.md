🗞 **ThreeFold in the News** 🗞

<br/>

Today, data processing infrastructure is in short supply throughout Africa... ”700 new data centers" would have to be built to meet current demand in Africa… 

<br/>

**To connect end-users in Africa** to a pipeline of instantaneous processing capacity, Computecoin is **joining forces** with a few other key players such as Crust and ThreeFold. CCN's unique protocol will optimize computing resources provided by Crust's Web3.0 storage platform and **ThreeFold's p2p network** and **ensure the computing resources are efficiently deployed** through the CCN network.
