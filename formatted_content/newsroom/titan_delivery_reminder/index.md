📦 **Titan Delivery Update & Reminder**

<br/>

Global Titan shipping is ongoing in all regions!

<br/>

If you ordered a Titan but have not yet received it, it could be that we are missing information from you. Please make sure you have created your V3 farm to ensure quick delivery.

<br/>

Our support team is available via [threefold.io](https://threefold.io) or on the ThreeFold Connect app with any questions.

<br/>

*If you are an existing farmer and still need to [upgrade to V3](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes), please do so asap.*
