🎙 **Don't Miss the ThreeFold Podcast**

<br/>

Just in time for the weekend, be sure to check out [the ThreeFold Podcast](https://anchor.fm/threefoldpodcast), an ongoing podcast series hosted by Kyle Ellicott about ThreeFold's efforts towards building an open-source, peer-to-peer, carbon-negative decentralized Internet for the deployment of any current and future technology.

<br/>

We have five episodes live so far, the latest a conversation with co-founder Weynand Kuijpers on space, self-hosted data centers, and the latest partnership details between ownCloud and ThreeFold.
