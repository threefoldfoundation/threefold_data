Last month, we opened up **[a two-way chat](https://t.me/threefold)** here on Telegram for our community to have conversations about ThreeFold, ask questions, and offer feedback. If you haven’t joined yet, please do!
<br />
<br />
Let's just say that we've learned a lot! There have been many discussions and lots of valuable feedback that we are taking action on already. This also led us to put **[some thoughts](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/threefold__how_to_use_chat)** together on who we are, the chat, transparency, feedback, contribution, and more.
<br />
<br />
We don't see ourselves as a company or organization, but a group of people part of a movement that's bringing better solutions for people and our planet.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of the ThreeFold movement and we hope to see you / hear from you – in the main group, farmers group, testing group, on Github, on the forum, and beyond! 🙏
