📣 **New Partner on the Global 3Node Marketplace**

<br/>

We’re excited to announce a new 3Node partner for North America on the Global 3Node Marketplace: **Duck Farm Data**!

<br/>

Started by farmer and community member Nelson Anderson, Duck Farm Data has launched its first product, “The Peking,” this week.

<br/>

As a long-term farmer with an impressive setup, Nelson knows what people looking to start or expand their farm want. And he plans to build out several new models of certified 3Nodes in the near future.

<br/>
