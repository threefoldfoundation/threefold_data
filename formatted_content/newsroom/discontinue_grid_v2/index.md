Starting next month, [Grid v2 will be discontinued](https://forum.threefold.io/t/discontinuation-grid-v2/3385), along with all platforms in support of this Grid that are no longer needed on v3.

<br/>

This will ensure the grid is fully updated to its latest version and that all our development resources can be focused on the new grid instead of maintaining the older version.

<br/>

Keep in mind, minting will only be supported on v3. So, for all v2 farmers, please [migrate to v3](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143) **before the end of the month** to continue receiving minting payouts.

<br/>

_The [farming chat](https://t.me/threefoldfarmers) and [the forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) are great resources if you have any questions. _*_Together_*_ we build!_ 💪
