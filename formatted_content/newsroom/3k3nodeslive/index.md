🎉 **A ThreeFold Grid Milestone**

<br/>

**We have now crossed 3,000 3Nodes connected to the ThreeFold Grid, across 78 countries.**

<br/>

Thank you to the early farmers for leading the way in laying the foundation for a decentralized, open, inclusive, regenerative, and resilient Internet. You are true pioneers.

<br/>

Much more to come. Together we build!

<br/>

*By the way, if you are a farmer but have not yet [migrated your 3Node(s) to v3](https://forum.threefold.io/t/farming-migration-grid-v2-v3/2143?u=hannahcordes), please do so as soon as possible.* 🙏
