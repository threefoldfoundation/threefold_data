Having a Communication Science background, Victoria is eagerly using her skill set within the communication team at ThreeFold. She has always been seeking to ‘do good’, whether it concerns working for the environment, animals, or people. Victoria is indeed a strong advocate for the preservation and protection of environmental, human and animal rights. Taking a political science stance throughout her Master programme specializing in Global Environmental Governance, Sustainability & Climate Change, she gained a better understanding of the way societies work, the urgency of the climate crisis, how to actually spark change and take concrete action. She envisions for the future a more egalitarian society, one which lives in greater harmony with the environment and that has an inclusive economic system. Victoria craves being a part of making this world of ours a better place, and is excited to start with changing the internet and how we use it with the organization!
